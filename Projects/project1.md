# Project Unit 1

## Criterion A: Planning
### Problem Definition

My client is a well-known philanthropist. After learning at an international high school, they have been working on opening a similar campus in their home country. They want to be able to standardise communication between students and teachers, and also have a way to have a record of said communication methods that keeps track of when students graduate or teachers leave, so tat they can be made null and void.

### Solution

I will create an address book, containing an standard email address generator for the school, that follows a specific format. On top of that, the address book will also store all valid and in-use school emails, adding new addresses and deleting redundant ones between school years.

### Why Python?


### Success Criteria

1. Enter the names of all incoming students, as well as their graduating year
2. Generate emails for these students, and add them to a file containing all students for that year.
3. Must delete all redundant addresses, or a specific email addresses when prompted by the user
4. Must allow user's to open the file, or search for an address if they want.
5. 

Hidden Functionality:
1. If the user enters the secret code ("happyplaces2024"), the program will change modes and act as a password manager.
2. In password manager mode, the user should be able to:
  * Add a password (for example, for a website).
  * View the stored passwords (only if they re-enter the secret code).
  * Optionally, display the passwords in a "masked" form (e.g., showing only the first and last characters).
  * Remove any redundant passwords at the user's prompting
3. Basic Security Features - Implementing a basic obfuscation technique or basic encryption (e.g., reversing the password string or shifting characters by a fixed number) 
4. Store the passwords with the use of a text file

## Criterion B: Design

### Flow Diagrams for Algorithms

### Data Storage

All the data in my program with be stored using .csv files
